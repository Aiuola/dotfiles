# Welcome to the home of our new dynasty

All my dotfiles :)

Depdendencies:

### neovim from scratch

- packer.nvim - install [here](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

Need to migrate to [this](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

### NvChad neovim

- Just install [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad ) from git via
`git clone https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad ~/.config/nvim --depth 1`

### Other dot files

- No extra stuff

## Install script

The assumption is that this repo was cloned in ``~/dotfiles`` if this is not
the case then just modify the script.

You might need to give priviliges to the script via ``chmod +x init.sh``

Then simply run it ``./init.sh``
